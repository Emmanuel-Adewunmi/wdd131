            <h2>Alma 48:17</h2>
            <p>Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni,
                behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over
                the hearts of the children of men.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 13:38</h2>
            <p>But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is
                everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your
                lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is
                contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</p>
